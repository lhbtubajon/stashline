A long term personal finance planning timeline app for IOS

This is forked from Trishume's open source "stashline" app for iOS, and is intended to add extra functionality for a few financial cases that are difficult to model in stashline:

Gradients
  Geometric
  Arithmetic

Range management
  I'm investigating other useful ways of adjusting cash flow ranges in the UI using combinations of presses and swipes.

Safe withdrawal rate
  Currently, the stashline safety factor for "when you can retire" is hard coded and fairly conservative. That's fine, but I would like to offer control of the risk factor to the planner while keeping Trishume's default in place.
  
End of period calculations
  Currently, stashline seems to use a "beginning of period" calculation method, whereas the finance standard is "end of period". So I'd like to adjust that.
  
Complex interest rates
  Money is sometimes invested at different rates according to its asset category. I'd like to implement some method of multiple investment rates of return. Ideas welcome.
